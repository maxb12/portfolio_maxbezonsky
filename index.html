      <p>This website will provide information and valid points about the class of Web Design. Things such as the lessons, rules, and concepts of the web design. As well as the different units we've gone through the whole year (as shown below).</p>

      <h2> Unit 1 Creating Pages With Html</h2>
      <p>I believe some terms that are very important in this first unit is the h1 tag, the p tag, the head tag, and the body tag.</p>
      <p>The most important skills I've learned in this lesson have been to add content to my website, learn codes and vocabulary words, and understand the concepts on building index and html portfolios.</p>
      <p> I feel like I study and really focus/understand on the steps and information that this course provides. It helps me really get a feel for web designing and overall computer functioning.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there are many things to improve in, such as understanding more of the vocabulary and starting to learn on how to continue your website invention.</p>
      <p> One problem I had was getting used to the code academy and codes for website organization. I then started to study and analyze more of the codes, and began getting used to it.</p>
      <p> I enjoyed learning so far about what it takes to understand website structure and all the steps and rules. If I was the teacher, I would be proud of the tough effort and resposibilty this student placed into getting the website structed and organized the way it shouldâ€™ve been.
